"""Verification harness for the Hermano save patch (needs pyboy + pillow).

Runs seven checks against a stock ROM and its patched counterpart:

  1. Rendering fidelity - with no save present the patched ROM must render
     essentially as the stock ROM does over a long run of identical input.
     The gameplay hooks sit on the vblank-synchronized update dispatch and
     cost nothing observable; hook_menu_start is the one hook on the state
     START path, where the display-off window is needed to touch VRAM, and
     it shifts the raster phase for single isolated frames when entering
     the title screen. So the assertion is that no divergence is ever
     sustained: every differing frame must resync on the very next one.
  2. Autosave - progress reaches SRAM once play begins, with a valid header.
  3. Power cycle - the save survives a cold boot and B restores it.
  4. Robustness - blank, truncated and corrupted saves are all ignored.
  5. Prompt - "B:CONTINUE" takes its turn on the title screen's bottom
     line only when there is a valid save to continue from.
  6. Level-start resume - a load must not bring back a mid-stage
     checkpoint; resuming always begins the saved stage from its start.
  8. Game over - reaching StateGameOver clears the save, because the
     game only ever enters that state once every continue is spent (the
     death path checks the counter first, and the other route zeroes it
     on the instruction before). The continue screen must not clear it.
  7. VRAM timing - every tilemap write must land during vblank or with
     the display off. The PPU silently rejects VRAM writes while it is
     fetching pixels, and because the hook runs at the same point in
     every frame the same cells get rejected every time - which does not
     look like a tear, it leaves the two messages permanently
     interleaved. Screen comparison does not catch this (and PyBoy does
     not model the restriction), so assert it directly.
